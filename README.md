After developing a database of over 4 million Tweets and posts from Reddit, our group designed "World in a Hashtag", a sentiment analysis app for topics, allowing users to determine the true opinions of a person, place or thing. Our homepage features trending tweets around the world. Searching your favorite topics will provide not only sentiment analysis, but show the trend of mentions over time, as well as a stream of recent Tweets and Reddit posts regarding the subject. You'll even find a stream of images shared via the two social media sites (mostly memes), as well as maps for events and places.
